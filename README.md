URL-based phishing detection is a crucial cybersecurity technique used to 
identify and prevent phishing attacks that exploit malicious URLs. Phishing is 
a form of cybercrime where attackers use deceptive emails, messages, or 
websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as login 
credentials, financial data, or personal details. A flexible and all-encompassing 
strategy to URL-based phishing detection is necessary to properly combat 
these assaults. A comprehensive approach is proposed in this project that 
makes use of a variety of machine learning methods, such as Decision Tree, 
XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), 
Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. The evaluation of the proposed approach is 
conducted using a comprehensive dataset containing both genuine and 
phishing URLs. Apart from these algorithms the Random Forest gives the best 
accuracy of 96%. After getting the accuracy, the model is integrated with flask. 
It is a micro web framework for building web applications in Python, with the 
use of flask a website is created in which if we gives a fake url it gives a pop up 
message and alert us that it is a wrong website. Moreover, this project gives 
the accuracy and reliability of phishing URL identification by integrating the 
strengths of several machine learning algorithms, making it possible for people 
and businesses to conduct business online in a more safe environment.
